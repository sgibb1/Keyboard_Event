# Keyboard_Event

In this activity you should only have a header and an empty <ol> tag in your HTML body. All of the other HTML on your page should be created with JavaScript.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Make an array of all 26 letters of the alphabet (lowercase).
Make a variable that will randomly pick one of the 26 letters as a secret letter.
Setup a keyboard event on the whole body.
If the key you pressed is the secret key, you should append "SECRET KEY PRESSED" to the body in a tag of your choice.
After the secret key is pressed, randomly pick another secret key and assign it to your secret key variable.
